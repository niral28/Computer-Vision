# Computer-Vision
This repo contains several key projects I worked on in my Computer Vision course. 

## Summary:
* Facial Recognition:
  Developed a facial recognition algorithm from scratch with the Yale-Face Dataset. Based on eigenfaces method.
* Bag of Words & CNN:
  Developed a custom bag of words algorithm to do object classification and compared the results to two neural networks ResNet & VGG16
* 3D Reconstruction:
  Completed a 3D reconstruction via point clouds and the SIFT algorithm 
* Billboard Homography:
  Simply used homography to project an image onto any billboard within a picture.
